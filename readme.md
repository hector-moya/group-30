Can i merge the canvas update?

Can i push these superficial changes? these do not change any functionality they are just for
consistency and convention

I am color coding the class diagram so you can see what is what. A green box indicates the I
consider the class to be complete, or correct for now. They may be updated as we go but for the
time being the diagram is the same as ore code base.

- update observable method names to `observeName` for consistency
- update observable subject names to `name$` for convention and consistency
- changed config `nextCol` and `nextRow` to `nextGridSize` for simplicity



- do we need to persist config?
